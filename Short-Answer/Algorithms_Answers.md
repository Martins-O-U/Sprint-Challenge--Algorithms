#### Please add your answers to the **_Analysis of Algorithms_** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) A has a big notation of 0(n), since the iteration while be done for some period as it comparesthe value of a to that of n\*3. The notation for the constant becomes negligible as the value of n increases. so 0(n) is more consequential.

b) B has a big notation of 0(n log n), this is because while there's a loop going on, the while condition cuts the looping at a point such that not all items in the list or range is searched through, 0(n log n) is more effective

c) C has a big notation of 0(n) as the recursive function only calls itself once and does only an action on each loop
